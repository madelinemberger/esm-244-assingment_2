##Task 3: Make a map of Hawaiian land use/land cover and watersheds

###Introduction
[insert some text about the project]



**References**
Land use/land cover data: http://geoportal.hawaii.gov/datasets/land-use-land-cover-lulc
Watershed data: http://geoportal.hawaii.gov/datasets/watersheds


###Explore the data
```{r}
#intial exploration
plot(lulc)


#may want to just visualize a few land use or land covers, or just one island.


unique(lulc$landcover)

#there are a lot of land uses / cover. I'm going to distill some of the uses into broader categories

```
**Plan is to: simplify the data, crop to a certain location, and create a clean graph with both types of data on there**
###Data cleaning and wrangling 
Land use and land cover
```{r}

#I am more interested in the natural land areas, so am going to combine the data based on some of the metadata categories
lulc_simple_2 <- lulc %>% 
  mutate(
    landcover = case_when(
      landcover %in% c("Residential",
                       "Other Urban or Built-up Land",

      landcover %in% c("Cropland and Pasture", 
                       "Orchards, Groves, Vineyards, Nurseries and Ornamental Horticultural Areas",

                       "Sandy Areas Other than Beaches") ~ "Barren Land",
      TRUE ~ landcover) #keep the rest the same
  ) %>% 
  filter(landcover != 0)

unique(lulc_simple_2$landcover)

plot(lulc_simple_2)


```

Watershed data
```{r}

#get rid of the some of the columns to simplify the data

watersheds_simple <- watersheds %>%
  select(wuname, hucarea, area_sqmi)

plot(watersheds_simple)



```


###Visualize

```{r}

ggplot(data = lulc_simple_2)+
  geom_sf(data = lulc_simple_2, 
          color = NA, 
          aes(fill = landcover))+
  annotation_scale(location = "bl", width_hint = 0.5) +
    annotation_north_arrow(location = "bl", which_north = "true", 
         pad_x = unit(0.5, "cm"), pad_y = unit(0.5, "cm"),
        style = north_arrow_fancy_orienteering)+
  scale_fill_paletteer_d("calecopal::figmtn")+
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(color = gray(.1), 
                                        linetype = "dashed", size = 0.1), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "aliceblue")
  )+
  labs(x = "Longitude", y = "Latitude")

#to do = change the colors, and clip it

#how to clip 
#world_base +
#coord_sf(xlim = c(-20, 50), ylim = c(-40, 40), expand = FALSE)



```

Watersheds
```{r}

ggplot(data = watersheds_simple)+
  geom_sf(data = watersheds_simple, 
          color = NA, 
          aes(fill = area_sqmi))+

  )+

#
- Clearly and professionally show the different watersheds for all main Hawaiian islands, or for an island or region of your choosing

There is flexibility! You can decide: 
- Do you want your maps to be static or interactive?
- What areas do you want to focus on? 
- Do you want to show land use/landcover and watersheds in a single map or in separate maps? 
- Whatever you decide is great, just make sure that your final outputs are presented in a nice professional HTML that youâ€™d be proud to share with someone so that they can see your awesome spatial code!
